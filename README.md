# Camera Dolly Control App
iOS App using CoreBluetooth framework to control a camera dolly system using an Arduino board
This app was designed to work exclusively with a HM10 BLE module. An Arduino board was in charge of all the movement of the camera dolly system and the app was required to start a routine and send some parameters as velocity, distance and delay time to the Arduino Board. 


Update October 2020: Currently working on refactoring existing code and changing UI to the final design. Final design:
